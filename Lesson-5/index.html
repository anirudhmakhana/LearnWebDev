    <!-- The method attribute specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is sent to the page specified in the action attribute). -->
    <!-- The post method will be able to encrypt the data when submitting. -->
    <!-- Notes on GET:

Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
Notes on POST:

Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown in URL)
Has no size limitations
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked -->
